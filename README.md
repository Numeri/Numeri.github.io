# Kaden Uhlig's personal blog

My name is Kaden Uhlig â€“ I'm a computer science major with an interest in linguistics, languages, deep learning, and the intersection of all three: machine translation.
I hope to get a Master's and PhD in machine translation, with the intent of going into research. This blog will document my journey and the ideas I have along the way.

## Blog Jekyll Theme
The theme used by this blog is a customized version of the [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) Jekyll theme. To use it yourself, take a look at its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).
