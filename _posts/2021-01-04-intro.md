title: Hello, World!
---


My name is Kaden Uhlig – I'm a computer science major with an interest in linguistics, languages, deep learning, and the intersection of all three: machine translation.
I hope to get a Master's and PhD in machine translation, with the intent of going into research. This blog will document my journey and the ideas I have along the way.

I've wanted to start writing for a while now, and a quick and easy blog with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like the way to do that. My top goals with
writing are fairly simple: I want to practice writing, I want to clarify some of my
thoughts (writing is amazing for that), and I'd love to keep myself motivated to do
larger projects – the kind I love reading about. Often, if I start a large project, I
need accountability and feedback to keep going once the initial momentum dies down. Even
if it doesn't have an audience, I hope this blog can do that for me.

In the end, if I dig down past my main motives, I'm writing because I love reading other
people's tech, math and science blogs. This is my little way to give back.
